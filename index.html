<p> My name is Chris. I am 29 years old. I was born in South Korea, adopted, and grew up in Charlottesville, Virginia. I have no previous experience or background in coding, but I became interested in the subject because my dad used to be a programmer for the Richmond Railroad when he was young. I'm not sure if I want to be a programmer specifically, but he suggested to me that it may be something I enjoy and a field in which I could potentially excel. I have found, so far that I enjoy it very much. It seems to be an ideal fit for my unreasonably perfectionistic nature.  </p>
